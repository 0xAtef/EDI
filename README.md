# Detect Map - Detection Use Cases Repository

Welcome to the Detect Map! This repository aims to collect and structure all the detection use cases based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for security professionals to develop effective detection strategies against cyber threats.

## Structure

The repository is structured according to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, organizing detection use cases by tactics and techniques. Each technique includes detailed information about detection strategies, including:

- **Sigma File**: Sigma rules for implementing detection logic in SIEM solutions.
- **Atomic Tests**: Atomic Red Team tests to validate the effectiveness of detection rules.
- **Logs (if available)**:  Sample logs or data to demonstrate the behavior associated with the technique.

## Bundles

In addition to individual detection use cases, we provide bundles that collect the latest reports for threat detection & intelligence. These bundles consolidate all covered detection use cases, making it easier for users to download and implement them in their security operations.

## CVEs Coverage

We also cover the latest Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) to make it easier for you to fortify yourself against known vulnerabilities. By integrating CVE data into our detection use cases, we aim to provide a holistic approach to threat detection and mitigation.
